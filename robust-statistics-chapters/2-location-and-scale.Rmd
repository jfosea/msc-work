# 2.1 Location model

- **Simplest location model**: We assume that the outcome $x_i$ of each observation depends on the “true value” $\mu$ of the unknown parameter and some random error process. A simple *location* model is

$$x_i = \mu + u_i \text{ }(i=1,\cdots, n) \tag{2.1} $$


- **Shift** and **Scale equivariance**: Let $\hat{\mu}$ be the sample mean and $c$ be any constant, then  $\hat{\mu}$ hold the following properties.

$$ 
\hat{\mu}(x_1 + c, \cdots, x_n + c) = \hat{\mu}(x_1, \cdots, x_n) + c \text{ (shift equivariance)}
$$

$$
\hat{\mu}(cx_1, \cdots, cx_n) = c\hat{\mu}(x_1, \cdots, x_n) \text{ (scale equivariance)}
$$


# 2.2 Formalizing departures from normality

- **Contaminated normal distributions (Tukey-Huber model)**: Let $A$ be the event "the appratus fails" which has $P(A)=\epsilon$. Then $F$ is is a *mixture* of $G$ and $H$ 

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(t) &= P(X \leq t) = P(X \leq t|A')P(A') + P(X \leq t)|(A) \\ 
&=G(t)(1-\epsilon) + H(t)\epsilon 
\end{aligned}
$$

- *Example 1*: Assume that 95% of our observations are well‐behaved, represented by $G = N(\mu,1)$ , but that 5% of the times the measuring system gives an erratic result, represented by a normal distribution with the same mean but a 10‐fold increase in the standard deviation. We thus have the model with $\epsilon = 0.05$ and $H=N(\mu, 100)$. The model is

$$F = (1-\epsilon)N(\mu,1) + \epsilon N(\mu, 100)$$

# 2.3 M-estimators of location

- **Generalizing maximum likelihood estimators** We know that MLE's maximize the likelihood function

    $$
    \hat{\mu} = \underset{\mu}{\arg \max } \hspace{0.15cm} L(\mu) =  \underset{\mu}{\arg \max } \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i, \mu)
    $$
    
    We generalize the MLE by maximizing other functions instead of the likelihood function. Given a function $\rho$, an *M-estimator of location* is a solution of 
          
    $$
    \hat{\mu} = \underset{\mu}{\arg \min } \hspace{0.15cm} \sum_{i=1}^n \rho (x_i, \mu)
    $$
    where $\rho$ is a function with certain properties.

- **Huber functions**: These functions are other loss functions that we can minimize.

    1. $\rho$-type
    
    $$
    \rho_k(x) = 
      \begin{cases}
      x^2 & \vert x \vert \leq k \\
      2k \vert x \vert - k^2 &\vert x \vert > k
      \end{cases}
    $$
    2. $\psi$-type
    
    
    $$
    \psi_k(x) = 
      \begin{cases}
      x & \vert x \vert \leq k \\
      sgn(x) k &\vert x \vert > k
      \end{cases}
    $$
