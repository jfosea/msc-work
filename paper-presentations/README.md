| A Natural Robustification of the Ordinary Instrumental Variables (IV) Estimator | *Main goal* is to propose a new robust IV (RIV) estimator which allows for the estimation of models with endogenous continuous covariates and exogenous dummy covariates. IV has the following properties: resilient to outliers, bounded influence function,  consistency under weak distributional assumptions, asymptotically normal under mild regularity conditions, and equivariance.  They compare performance of RIV using Monte Carlo simulation study and to the Framingham Heart Study cohort.                                                                                                                            | instrumental variables, robust estimation, endogenous covariate |
| Scaling up Mendelian Randomization for High-Dimensional -Omics Data             | Verifying validity of every instrument is increasingly challenging and laboursome as proteins  being considered for analysis increases. The *main goal* is to develop a two-stage causal regularized IV estimator called Thrice Robust IV Estimator (THIRVE). It leverages genetic variants (Mendelian Randomization)as IV's  to identify causal effects of proteins without confounding and reverse causality. THRIVE is an automated approach for model selection that  is robust against the violations of validity assumptions. They compare THRIVE with other competing estimators using a real-world prostate  cancer dataset. | mendelian randomization, regularization, high dimensional data  |
