# 1 Problem 
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates are biased and inconsistent when one the covariates is correlated with the error terms (*endogenous*). This happens when (1) covariate is associated with unobserved predictors, (2) is measured with error, and/or (3) affected by the response variable.
- Solution to this problem is to use Ordinary Instrumental Variables (OIV) to consistently estimate the parameters of the model. However, when used in real datasets, OIV's are often distorted due to outliers in the response variable.
- There are existing robust methods to obtain IV estimators as listed below

    1. Minimize robust loss function [(Amemiya, 1982)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1912608?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
    2. Robustify the estimating equations which define the OIV [(Krasker and Welsch, 1985)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1913223?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
    3. Orthogonality conditions which give rise to the OIV in the Generalized Method of Moments
    4. Robustify at each of the stages of the OIV since OIV's can be thought of as two-stage least squares estimator (2SLS).
    5. Robust estimators for simultaneous equation models

# 2 Objective

The authors propose a robust instrumental variable (RIV) estimator based on the robustification of the OIV's closed form formula. The authors replace the sample moments in an OIV with a robust multivariate location and scatter S-estimators. Under certain regularity conditions, the advantage of using S-estimators is that they are consistent, asymptotically normal, affine equivariant, positive definite, have bounded influence function and can achieve maximal breakdown point regardless of dimension.

# 3 Methods

The authors robusity OIV by replacing the sample estimators $(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\Sigma})$ with robust multivariate location and scatter S-estimator $(m, S)$.

$$\hat{\alpha}_{RIV} = m_Y - m'_x \hat{\beta}_{RIV}$$

$$\hat{\beta}_{RIV} = [S_{xz}S_{zz}^{-1}S_{zx}]^{-1} [S_{xz}S_{zz}^{-1}S_{zx}]$$
